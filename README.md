## What is this repository?

- A collection of designs that I am building.

- I'm mainly focussing on building out the designs in Vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript, but are not limited. The most used framework might be Tailwind CSS.

- That's all I have for now...will update as I continue.

## Naming convention

- If you want to see the landing page demos, just place `tsbdesigns-` and then the name of the folder in the repository for which you want to view, and then `.netlify.app` at the end. For example, if you want to view the landing page for the `nature` folder, you would type in `https://tsbdesigns-nature.netlify.app`...and so on and so forth...
